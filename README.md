#Fun-With-Fractals

On partial fulfillment of my diploma in Creative Computing, one of my assignments was to use Processing (an open-source graphical library using Java), was to create our own l-system in order to show how different patterns could be created using a simple string rule. 


<b>Animation shown when sketch is run</b>

The user is given the option to either start the looping sketch (animation), by pressing the space-bar or the enter key, this creates the final sketch with a randomly generated rgb (red, green, blue) values, in order to give a different colour with every newly generated design. The background is set to – r, -g, and –b so that there is contrast between the sketch and the background. Apart from this option, the user can choose to save the current state of the sketch by pressing “s” or “S”, reset the sketch (with a new colour) by pressing “r” or “R”, and exit the sketch by pressing “e” or “E”.
